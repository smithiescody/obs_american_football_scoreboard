# OBS American Football Scoreboard Software

Just a simple OBS Scoreboard for American Football.

Created this for my local sports news network broadcasts. Decided to share the software with everyone who would need it!

Similar to Scoreboard+, this app outputs everything into TXT files, making it easily to integrate into your own static designs on OBS.

Right now it's only for MacOS, since that is what we are using for our braodcasts. We can try and eventually port it over to Windows if we see the interest.
